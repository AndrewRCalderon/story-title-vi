## Introduction

This repository captures the ETL for the Title VI project. The project is a collaboratin between teh Center for Public Integrity and Andrew Rodriguez Calderon (computational journalist) and Grey Moran (investigative reporter).

The repo extracts, transforms and loads data from the following sources:

- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- The Center for Public Integrity (CPI)

The repo also contains the following:

- a Pipfile that captures the dependencies for the project
- a Makefile that orchestrates the ETL process
- the source data received from the EPA and from CPI
- code that loads and cleans the data
- some helper functions
- scaffolding for testing (not implemented)
