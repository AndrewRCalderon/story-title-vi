This concern includes emissions from several colocated and co-owned scrap processing facilities that were not included by Illinois EPA in its permitting process. Commentators expressed concerns about the air quality impacts posed by the hundreds of trucks that are needed to bring materials to the facility and to remove processed materials from the facility, especially on local PM-10 ambient air quality conditions. Because the permitted facility is transferring the business, operations and equipment from an existing metal shredder on Chicago’s northside, dozens of commentators provided detailed information about the troubled compliance history of this northside operation and urged Illinois EPA to develop measures to address recurrent problems. Equally important, they questioned Illinois EPA’s permitting process, which occurred during a pandemic, a period of local civil unrest and without translation services in a community where many residents are Spanish-speaking.
